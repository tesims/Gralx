### Fixes

- [#5816](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/5816) [`796145e2c`](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/commit/796145e2c48c4087bec17f8ec0be4ceee47170cb) - Fix calls to the component server so that `gr.FileExplorer` works on Spaces.  Thanks [@abidlabs](https://github.com/abidlabs)!

## 3.47.0

### Highlights

#### new `FileExplorer` component ([#5672](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/5672) [`e4a307ed6`](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/commit/e4a307ed6cde3bbdf4ff2f17655739addeec941e))

Thanks to a new capability that allows components to communicate directly with the server _without_ passing data via the value, we have created a new `FileExplorer` component.

This component allows you to populate the explorer by passing a glob, but only provides the selected file(s) in your prediction function. 

Users can then navigate the virtual filesystem and select files which will be accessible in your predict function. This component will allow developers to build more complex spaces, with more flexible input options.

![output](https://github.com/pngwn/MDsveX/assets/12937446/ef108f0b-0e84-4292-9984-9dc66b3e144d)

For more information check the [`FileExplorer` documentation](https://gradio.app/docs/fileexplorer).

Thanks [@aliabid94](https://github.com/aliabid94)!/n  get_config is removed, the config used is simply any attribute that is in the Block that shares a name with one of the constructor paramaters./n  update is not removed for backwards compatibility, but deprecated. Instead return the component itself. Created a updateable decorator that simply checks to see if we're in an update, and if so, skips the constructor and wraps the args and kwargs in an update dictionary. easy peasy.

## 3.41.0

### Highlights

#### Improve startup performance and markdown support ([#5279](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/5279) [`fe057300`](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/commit/fe057300f0672c62dab9d9b4501054ac5d45a4ec))

##### Improved markdown support

We now have better support for markdown in `gr.Markdown` and `gr.Dataframe`. Including syntax highlighting and Github Flavoured Markdown. We also have more consistent markdown behaviour and styling.

##### Various performance improvements

These improvements will be particularly beneficial to large applications.

- Rather than attaching events manually, they are now delegated, leading to a significant performance improvement and addressing a performance regression introduced in a recent version of Gradio. App startup for large applications is now around twice as fast.
- Optimised the mounting of individual components, leading to a modest performance improvement during startup (~30%).
- Corrected an issue that was causing markdown to re-render infinitely.
- Ensured that the `gr.3DModel` does re-render prematurely.

 Thanks [@pngwn](https://github.com/pngwn)!

#### Enable streaming audio in python client ([#5248](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/5248) [`390624d8`](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/commit/390624d8ad2b1308a5bf8384435fd0db98d8e29e))

The `gradio_client` now supports streaming file outputs 🌊

No new syntax! Connect to a gradio demo that supports streaming file outputs and call `predict` or `submit` as you normally would.

```python
import gradio_client as grc
client = grc.Client("gradio/stream_audio_out")

# Get the entire generated audio as a local file
client.predict("/Users/freddy/Pictures/bark_demo.mp4", api_name="/predict")

job = client.submit("/Users/freddy/Pictures/bark_demo.mp4", api_name="/predict")

# Get the entire generated audio as a local file
job.result()

# Each individual chunk
job.outputs()
```

 Thanks [@freddyaboulton](https://github.com/freddyaboulton)!

#### Add `render` function to `<gradio-app>` ([#5158](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/5158) [`804fcc05`](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/commit/804fcc058e147f283ece67f1f353874e26235535))

We now have an event `render` on the <gradio-app> web component, which is triggered once the embedded space has finished rendering.

```html
<script>
	function handleLoadComplete() {
		console.log("Embedded space has finished rendering");
	}
	const gradioApp = document.querySelector("gradio-app");
	gradioApp.addEventListener("render", handleLoadComplete);
</script>
```

## 3.40.0

### Highlights

#### Client.predict will now return the final output for streaming endpoints ([#5057](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/5057) [`35856f8b`](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/commit/35856f8b54548cae7bd3b8d6a4de69e1748283b2))

### This is a breaking change (for gradio_client only)!

Previously, `Client.predict` would only return the first output of an endpoint that streamed results. This was causing confusion for developers that wanted to call these streaming demos via the client.

We realize that developers using the client don't know the internals of whether a demo streams or not, so we're changing the behavior of predict to match developer expectations.

Using `Client.predict` will now return the final output of a streaming endpoint. This will make it even easier to use gradio apps via the client.

 Thanks [@freddyaboulton](https://github.com/freddyaboulton)!

#### Gradio now supports streaming audio outputs

Allows users to use generators to stream audio out, yielding consecutive chunks of audio. Requires `streaming=True` to be set on the output audio.

```python
import gradio as gr
from pydub import AudioSegment

def stream_audio(audio_file):
    audio = AudioSegment.from_mp3(audio_file)
    i = 0
    chunk_size = 3000
    
    while chunk_size*i < len(audio):
        chunk = audio[chunk_size*i:chunk_size*(i+1)]
        i += 1
        if chunk:
            file = f"/tmp/{i}.mp3"
            chunk.export(file, format="mp3")            
            yield file
        
demo = gr.Interface(
    fn=stream_audio,
    inputs=gr.Audio(type="filepath", label="Audio file to stream"),
    outputs=gr.Audio(autoplay=True, streaming=True),
)

demo.queue().launch()
```

From the backend, streamed outputs are served from the `/stream/` endpoint instead of the `/file/` endpoint. Currently just used to serve audio streaming output.  The output JSON will have `is_stream`: `true`, instead of `is_file`: `true` in the file data object. Thanks [@aliabid94](https://github.com/aliabid94)!

## 3.39.0

### Highlights

#### Create Discord Bots from Gradio Apps 🤖 ([#4960](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/4960) [`46e4ef67`](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/commit/46e4ef67d287dd68a91473b73172b29cbad064bc))

We're excited to announce that Gradio can now automatically create a discord bot from any `gr.ChatInterface` app.

It's as easy as importing `gradio_client`, connecting to the app, and calling `deploy_discord`!

_🦙 Turning Llama 2 70b into a discord bot 🦙_

```python
import gradio_client as grc
grc.Client("ysharma/Explore_llamav2_with_TGI").deploy_discord(to_id="llama2-70b-discord-bot")
```

<img src="https://gradio-builds.s3.amazonaws.com/demo-files/discordbots/guide/llama_chat.gif">

#### Getting started with template spaces

To help get you started, we have created an organization on Hugging Face called [gradio-discord-bots](https://huggingface.co/gradio-discord-bots) with template spaces you can use to turn state of the art LLMs powered by Gradio to discord bots.

Currently we have template spaces for:

- [Llama-2-70b-chat-hf](https://huggingface.co/spaces/gradio-discord-bots/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf) powered by a FREE Hugging Face Inference Endpoint!
- [Llama-2-13b-chat-hf](https://huggingface.co/spaces/gradio-discord-bots/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf) powered by Hugging Face Inference Endpoints.
- [Llama-2-13b-chat-hf](https://huggingface.co/spaces/gradio-discord-bots/llama-2-13b-chat-transformers) powered by Hugging Face transformers.
- [falcon-7b-instruct](https://huggingface.co/spaces/gradio-discord-bots/falcon-7b-instruct) powered by Hugging Face Inference Endpoints.
- [gpt-3.5-turbo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/gradio-discord-bots/gpt-35-turbo), powered by openai. Requires an OpenAI key.

But once again, you can deploy ANY `gr.ChatInterface` app exposed on the internet! So don't hesitate to try it on your own Chatbots.

❗️ Additional Note ❗️: Technically, any gradio app that exposes an api route that takes in a single string and outputs a single string can be deployed to discord. But `gr.ChatInterface` apps naturally lend themselves to discord's chat functionality so we suggest you start with those.

Thanks [@freddyaboulton](https://github.com/freddyaboulton)!

## 3.37

### New Features:

Introducing a new `gr.ChatInterface` abstraction, which allows Gradio users to build fully functioning Chat interfaces very easily. The only required parameter is a chat function `fn`, which accepts a (string) user input `message` and a (list of lists) chat `history` and returns a (string) response. Here's a toy example:

```py
import gradio as gr

def echo(message, history):
    return message

demo = gr.ChatInterface(fn=echo, examples=["hello", "hola", "merhaba"], title="Echo Bot")
demo.launch()
```

Which produces:

<img width="1291" alt="image" src="https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/assets/1778297/ae94fd72-c2bb-406e-9e8d-7b9c12e80119">

And a corresponding easy-to-use API at `/chat`:

<img width="1164" alt="image" src="https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/assets/1778297/7b10d6db-6476-4e2e-bebd-ecda802c3b8f">

The `gr.ChatInterface` abstraction works nicely with various LLM libraries, such as `langchain`. See the [dedicated guide](https://gradio.app/guides/creating-a-chatbot-fast) for more examples using `gr.ChatInterface`. Collective team effort in [PR 4869](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/4869)

- Chatbot messages now show hyperlinks to download files uploaded to `gr.Chatbot()` by [@dawoodkhan82](https://github.com/dawoodkhan82) in [PR 4848](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/4848)
- Cached examples now work with generators and async generators by [@abidlabs](https://github.com/abidlabs) in [PR 4927](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/4927)
- Add RTL support to `gr.Markdown`, `gr.Chatbot`, `gr.Textbox` (via the `rtl` boolean parameter) and text-alignment to `gr.Textbox`(via the string `text_align` parameter) by [@abidlabs](https://github.com/abidlabs) in [PR 4933](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/4933)

Examples of usage:

```py
with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    gr.Textbox(interactive=True, text_align="right")
demo.launch()
```

```py
with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    gr.Markdown("سلام", rtl=True)
demo.launch()
```

- The `get_api_info` method of `Blocks` now supports layout output components [@freddyaboulton](https://github.com/freddyaboulton) in [PR 4871](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/4871)

- Added the support for the new command `gradio environment`to make it easier for people to file bug reports if we shipped an easy command to list the OS, gradio version, and versions of gradio/gradio-client dependencies. bu [@varshneydevansh](https://github.com/varshneydevansh) in [PR 4915](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/4915).

### Bug Fixes:

- The `.change()` event is fixed in `Video` and `Image` so that it only fires once by [@abidlabs](https://github.com/abidlabs) in [PR 4793](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/4793)
- The `.change()` event is fixed in `Audio` so that fires when the component value is programmatically updated by [@abidlabs](https://github.com/abidlabs) in [PR 4793](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/4793)

* Add missing `display: flex` property to `Row` so that flex styling is applied to children by [@hannahblair] in [PR 4896](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/4896)
* Fixed bug where `gr.Video` could not preprocess urls by [@freddyaboulton](https://github.com/freddyaboulton) in [PR 4904](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/4904)
* Fixed copy button rendering in API page on Safari by [@aliabid94](https://github.com/aliabid94) in [PR 4924](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/4924)
* Fixed `gr.Group` and `container=False`. `container` parameter only available for `Textbox`, `Number`, and `Dropdown`, the only elements where it makes sense. By [@aliabid94](https://github.com/aliabid94) in [PR 4916](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/4916)
* Fixed broken image link in auto-generated `app.py` from `ThemeClass.push_to_hub` by [@deepkyu](https://github.com/deepkyu) in [PR 4944](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/4944)

### Other Changes:

- Warning on mobile that if a user leaves the tab, websocket connection may break. On broken connection, tries to rejoin queue and displays error conveying connection broke. By [@aliabid94](https://github.com/aliabid94) in [PR 4742](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/4742)
- Remove blocking network calls made before the local URL gets printed - these slow down the display of the local URL, especially when no internet is available. [@aliabid94](https://github.com/aliabid94) in [PR 4905](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/4905).
- Pinned dependencies to major versions to reduce the likelihood of a broken `gradio` due to changes in downstream dependencies by [@abidlabs](https://github.com/abidlabs) in [PR 4885](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/4885)
- Queue `max_size` defaults to parent Blocks `max_thread` when running on Spaces with ZeroGPU hardware. By [@cbensimon](https://github.com/cbensimon) in [PR 4937](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/4937)

### Breaking Changes:

Motivated by the release of `pydantic==2.0`, which included breaking changes that broke a large number of Gradio apps, we've pinned many gradio dependencies. Note that pinned dependencies can cause downstream conflicts, so this may be a breaking change. That being said, we've kept the pins pretty loose, and we're expecting change to be better for the long-term stability of Gradio apps.

Example usage:

```python
with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    img = gr.Image()
    img_section = gr.AnnotatedImage()
    def mask(img):
        top_left_corner = [0, 0, 20, 20]
        random_mask = np.random.randint(0, 2, img.shape[:2])
        return (img, [(top_left_corner, "left corner"), (random_mask, "random")])
    img.change(mask, img, img_section)
```

###### Theme Sharing 🎨 🤝

You can now share your gradio themes with the world!

After creating a theme, you can upload it to the HuggingFace Hub to let others view it, use it, and build off of it!

###### Uploading

There are two ways to upload a theme, via the theme class instance or the command line.

1. Via the class instance

```python
my_theme.push_to_hub(repo_name="my_theme",
                     version="0.2.0",
                     hf_token="...")
```

2. Via the command line

First save the theme to disk

```python
my_theme.dump(filename="my_theme.json")
```

Then use the `upload_theme` command:

```bash
upload_theme\
"my_theme.json"\
"my_theme"\
"0.2.0"\
"<hf-token>"
```

The `version` must be a valid [semantic version](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-semantic-versioning/) string.

This creates a space on the huggingface hub to host the theme files and show potential users a preview of your theme.

An example theme space is here: https://huggingface.co/spaces/freddyaboulton/dracula_revamped

###### Downloading

To use a theme from the hub, use the `from_hub` method on the `ThemeClass` and pass it to your app:

```python
my_theme = gr.Theme.from_hub("freddyaboulton/my_theme")

with gr.Blocks(theme=my_theme) as demo:
    ....
```

You can also pass the theme string directly to `Blocks` or `Interface` (`gr.Blocks(theme="freddyaboulton/my_theme")`)

You can pin your app to an upstream theme version by using semantic versioning expressions.

For example, the following would ensure the theme we load from the `my_theme` repo was between versions `0.1.0` and `0.2.0`:

```python
with gr.Blocks(theme="freddyaboulton/my_theme@>=0.1.0,<0.2.0") as demo:
    ....
```

by [@freddyaboulton](https://github.com/freddyaboulton) in [PR 3428](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/3428)

###### Code component 🦾

New code component allows you to enter, edit and display code with full syntax highlighting by [@pngwn](https://github.com/pngwn) in [PR 3421](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/3421)

###### The `Chatbot` component now supports audio, video, and images

The `Chatbot` component now supports audio, video, and images with a simple syntax: simply
pass in a tuple with the URL or filepath (the second optional element of the tuple is alt text), and the image/audio/video will be displayed:

```python
gr.Chatbot([
    (("driving.mp4",), "cool video"),
    (("cantina.wav",), "cool audio"),
    (("lion.jpg", "A lion"), "cool pic"),
]).style(height=800)
```

- Added the `.select()` event listener, which also includes event data that can be passed as an argument to a function with type hint `gr.SelectData`. The following components support the `.select()` event listener: Chatbot, CheckboxGroup, Dataframe, Dropdown, File, Gallery, HighlightedText, Label, Radio, TabItem, Tab, Textbox. Example usage:

```python
import gradio as gr

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    gallery = gr.Gallery(["images/1.jpg", "images/2.jpg", "images/3.jpg"])
    selected_index = gr.Textbox()

    def on_select(evt: gr.SelectData):
        return evt.index

    gallery.select(on_select, None, selected_index)
```

###### Improved embedding experience

When embedding a spaces-hosted gradio app as a web component, you now get an improved UI linking back to the original space, better error handling and more intelligent load performance. No changes are required to your code to benefit from this enhanced experience; simply upgrade your gradio SDK to the latest version.

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12937446/219653294-86937632-72c1-4e93-a77c-af705d49382a.png)

This behaviour is configurable. You can disable the info panel at the bottom by passing `info="false"`. You can disable the container entirely by passing `container="false"`.

Error statuses are reported in the UI with an easy way for end-users to report problems to the original space author via the community tab of that Hugginface space:

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12937446/219655499-88019443-d694-44e7-9e6d-242e19d10a5c.png)

By default, gradio apps are lazy loaded, vastly improving performance when there are several demos on the page. Metadata is loaded ahead of time, but the space will only be loaded and rendered when it is in view.

This behaviour is configurable. You can pass `eager="true"` to load and render the space regardless of whether or not it is currently on the screen.

by [@pngwn](https://github.com/pngwn) in [PR 3205](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/3205)

###### New `gr.BarPlot` component! 📊

Create interactive bar plots from a high-level interface with `gr.BarPlot`.
No need to remember matplotlib syntax anymore!

Example usage:

```python
import gradio as gr
import pandas as pd

simple = pd.DataFrame({
    'a': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I'],
    'b': [28, 55, 43, 91, 81, 53, 19, 87, 52]
})

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    gr.BarPlot(
        simple,
        x="a",
        y="b",
        title="Simple Bar Plot with made up data",
        tooltip=['a', 'b'],
    )

demo.launch()
```

### New Features:

###### Revamped Stop Button for Interfaces 🛑

If your Interface function is a generator, there used to be a separate `Stop` button displayed next
to the `Submit` button.

We've revamed the `Submit` button so that it turns into a `Stop` button during the generation process.
Clicking on the `Stop` button will cancel the generation and turn it back to a `Submit` button.
The `Stop` button will automatically turn back to a `Submit` button at the end of the generation if you don't use it!

By [@freddyaboulton](https://github.com/freddyaboulton) in [PR 3124](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/3124)

###### Queue now works with reload mode!

run the script in reload mode with the `gradio` command.

Any changes to the `app.py` file will be reflected in the webpage automatically and the queue will work
properly!

###### Support for altair plots

The `Plot` component can now accept altair plots as values!
Simply return an altair plot from your event listener and gradio will display it in the front-end.
See the example below:

```python
import gradio as gr
import altair as alt
from vega_datasets import data

cars = data.cars()
chart = (
    alt.Chart(cars)
    .mark_point()
    .encode(
        x="Horsepower",
        y="Miles_per_Gallon",
        color="Origin",
    )
)

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    gr.Plot(value=chart)
demo.launch()
```

###### Set the background color of a Label component

The `Label` component now accepts a `color` argument by [@freddyaboulton](https://github.com/freddyaboulton) in [PR 2736](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2736).
The `color` argument should either be a valid css color name or hexadecimal string.
You can update the color with `gr.Label.update`!

This lets you create Alert and Warning boxes with the `Label` component. See below:

```python
import gradio as gr
import random

def update_color(value):
    if value < 0:
        # This is bad so use red
        return "#FF0000"
    elif 0 <= value <= 20:
        # Ok but pay attention (use orange)
        return "#ff9966"
    else:
        # Nothing to worry about
        return None

def update_value():
    choice = random.choice(['good', 'bad', 'so-so'])
    color = update_color(choice)
    return gr.Label.update(value=choice, color=color)


with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    label = gr.Label(value=-10)
    demo.load(lambda: update_value(), inputs=None, outputs=[label], every=1)
demo.queue().launch()
```

## 3.12.0

### New Features:

###### The `Chatbot` component now supports a subset of Markdown (including bold, italics, code, images)

You can now pass in some Markdown to the Chatbot component and it will show up,
meaning that you can pass in images as well! by [@abidlabs](https://github.com/abidlabs) in [PR 2731](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2731)

Here's a simple example that references a local image `lion.jpg` that is in the same
folder as the Python script:

```py
import gradio as gr

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    gr.Chatbot([("hi", "hello **abubakar**"), ("![](/file=lion.jpg)", "cool pic")])

demo.launch()
```

![Alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1778297/204357455-5c1a4002-eee7-479d-9a1e-ba2c12522723.png)

To see a more realistic example, see the new demo `/demo/chatbot_multimodal/run.py`.

###### Latex support

Added mathtext (a subset of latex) support to gr.Markdown. Added by [@kashif](https://github.com/kashif) and [@aliabid94](https://github.com/aliabid94) in [PR 2696](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2696).

    # Hello World! $\frac{\sqrt{x + y}}{4}$ is today's lesson.
    """)
```

###### Update Accordion properties from the backend

You can now update the Accordion `label` and `open` status with `gr.Accordion.update` by [@freddyaboulton](https://github.com/freddyaboulton) in [PR 2690](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2690)

```python
import gradio as gr

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    with gr.Accordion(label="Open for greeting", open=False) as accordion:
        gr.Textbox("Hello!")
    open_btn = gr.Button(value="Open Accordion")
    close_btn = gr.Button(value="Close Accordion")
    open_btn.click(
        lambda: gr.Accordion.update(open=True, label="Open Accordion"),
        inputs=None,
        outputs=[accordion],
    )
    close_btn.click(
        lambda: gr.Accordion.update(open=False, label="Closed Accordion"),
        inputs=None,
        outputs=[accordion],

### Contributors Shoutout:

- [@andridns](https://github.com/andridns) made their first contribution in [PR 2722](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2722)!

## 3.11.0

### New Features:

###### Upload Button

There is now a new component called the `UploadButton` which is a file upload component but in button form! You can also specify what file types it should accept in the form of a list (ex: `image`, `video`, `audio`, `text`, or generic `file`). Added by [@dawoodkhan82](https://github.com/dawoodkhan82) in [PR 2591](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2591).

Example of how it can be used:

```python
import gradio as gr

def upload_file(files):
    file_paths = [file.name for file in files]
    return file_paths

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    file_output = gr.File()
    upload_button = gr.UploadButton("Click to Upload a File", file_types=["image", "video"], file_count="multiple")
    upload_button.upload(upload_file, upload_button, file_output)

demo.launch()
```

###### Revamped API documentation page

New API Docs page with in-browser playground and updated aesthetics. [@gary149](https://github.com/gary149) in [PR 2652](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2652)

###### Revamped Login page

Previously our login page had its own CSS, had no dark mode, and had an ugly json message on the wrong credentials. Made the page more aesthetically consistent, added dark mode support, and a nicer error message. [@aliabid94](https://github.com/aliabid94) in [PR 2684](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2684)

###### Accessing the Requests Object Directly

You can now access the Request object directly in your Python function by [@abidlabs](https://github.com/abidlabs) in [PR 2641](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2641). This means that you can access request headers, the client IP address, and so on. In order to use it, add a parameter to your function and set its type hint to be `gr.Request`. Here's a simple example:

```py
import gradio as gr

def echo(name, request: gr.Request):
    if request:
        print("Request headers dictionary:", request.headers)
        print("IP address:", request.client.host)
    return name

io = gr.Interface(echo, "textbox", "textbox").launch()
```

### Bug Fixes:

- Fixed bug that limited files from being sent over websockets to 16MB. The new limit
  is now 1GB by [@abidlabs](https://github.com/abidlabs) in [PR 2709](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/2709)

### Documentation Changes:

to call with the `api_name` parameter.

```python
import gradio as gr
english_translator = gr.Blocks.load(name="spaces/gradio/english-translator")
german = english_translator("My name is Freddy", api_name='translate-to-german')

### New Features:

###### Running Events Continuously

Gradio now supports the ability to run an event continuously on a fixed schedule. To use this feature,
pass `every=# of seconds` to the event definition. This will run the event every given number of seconds!

This can be used to:

- Create live visualizations that show the most up to date data
- Refresh the state of the frontend automatically in response to changes in the backend

Here is an example of a live plot that refreshes every half second:

```python
import math
import gradio as gr
import plotly.express as px
import numpy as np


plot_end = 2 * math.pi


def get_plot(period=1):
    global plot_end
    x = np.arange(plot_end - 2 * math.pi, plot_end, 0.02)
    y = np.sin(2*math.pi*period * x)
    fig = px.line(x=x, y=y)
    plot_end += 2 * math.pi
    return fig


with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    with gr.Row():
        with gr.Column():
            gr.Markdown("Change the value of the slider to automatically update the plot")
            period = gr.Slider(label="Period of plot", value=1, minimum=0, maximum=10, step=1)
            plot = gr.Plot(label="Plot (updates every half second)")

    dep = demo.load(get_plot, None, plot, every=0.5)
    period.change(get_plot, period, plot, every=0.5, cancels=[dep])

demo.queue().launch()
```

functions which take in a list of inputs and return a list of predictions.

For example, here is a batched function that takes in two lists of inputs (a list of
words and a list of ints), and returns a list of trimmed words as output:

```py
import time

def trim_words(words, lens):
    trimmed_words = []
    time.sleep(5)
    for w, l in zip(words, lens):
        trimmed_words.append(w[:l])
    return [trimmed_words]
```

The advantage of using batched functions is that if you enable queuing, the Gradio
server can automatically _batch_ incoming requests and process them in parallel,
potentially speeding up your demo. Here's what the Gradio code looks like (notice
the `batch=True` and `max_batch_size=16` -- both of these parameters can be passed
into event triggers or into the `Interface` class)

```py
import gradio as gr

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    with gr.Row():
        word = gr.Textbox(label="word", value="abc")
        leng = gr.Number(label="leng", precision=0, value=1)
        output = gr.Textbox(label="Output")
    with gr.Row():
        run = gr.Button()

    event = run.click(trim_words, [word, leng], output, batch=True, max_batch_size=16)

demo.queue()
demo.launch()
```

In the example above, 16 requests could be processed in parallel (for a total inference
time of 5 seconds), instead of each request being processed separately (for a total
inference time of 80 seconds).

###### Upload Event

`Video`, `Audio`, `Image`, and `File` components now support a `upload()` event that is triggered when a user uploads a file into any of these components.

Example usage:

```py
import gradio as gr

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    with gr.Row():
        input_video = gr.Video()
        output_video = gr.Video()

     # Clears the output video when an input video is uploaded
    input_video.upload(lambda : None, None, output_video)
```

### New Features:

###### Cancelling Running Events

Running events can be cancelled when other events are triggered! To test this feature, pass the `cancels` parameter to the event listener.
For this feature to work, the queue must be enabled.

![cancel_on_change_rl](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41651716/195952623-61a606bd-e82b-4e1a-802e-223154cb8727.gif)

Code:

```python
import time
import gradio as gr

def fake_diffusion(steps):
    for i in range(steps):
        time.sleep(1)
        yield str(i)

def long_prediction(*args, **kwargs):
    time.sleep(10)
    return 42


with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    with gr.Row():
        with gr.Column():
            n = gr.Slider(1, 10, value=9, step=1, label="Number Steps")
            run = gr.Button()
            output = gr.Textbox(label="Iterative Output")
            stop = gr.Button(value="Stop Iterating")
        with gr.Column():
            prediction = gr.Number(label="Expensive Calculation")
            run_pred = gr.Button(value="Run Expensive Calculation")
        with gr.Column():
            cancel_on_change = gr.Textbox(label="Cancel Iteration and Expensive Calculation on Change")

    click_event = run.click(fake_diffusion, n, output)
    stop.click(fn=None, inputs=None, outputs=None, cancels=[click_event])
    pred_event = run_pred.click(fn=long_prediction, inputs=None, outputs=prediction)

    cancel_on_change.change(None, None, None, cancels=[click_event, pred_event])


demo.queue(concurrency_count=1, max_size=20).launch()
```

For interfaces, a stop button will be added automatically if the function uses a `yield` statement.

```python
import gradio as gr
import time

def iteration(steps):
    for i in range(steps):
       time.sleep(0.5)
       yield i

gr.Interface(iteration,
             inputs=gr.Slider(minimum=1, maximum=10, step=1, value=5),
             outputs=gr.Number()).queue().launch()
```

## 3.4

### New Features:

###### 1. Gallery Captions 🖼️

You can now pass captions to images in the Gallery component. To do so you need to pass a {List} of (image, {str} caption) tuples. This is optional and the component also accepts just a list of the images.

Here's an example:

```python
import gradio as gr

images_with_captions = [
    ("https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1551969014-7d2c4cddf0b6", "Cheetah by David Groves"),
    ("https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1546182990-dffeafbe841d", "Lion by Francesco"),
    ("https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1561731216-c3a4d99437d5", "Tiger by Mike Marrah")
    ]

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    gr.Gallery(value=images_with_captions)

demo.launch()
```

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/192399521-7360b1a9-7ce0-443e-8e94-863a230a7dbe.gif" alt="gallery_captions" width="1000"/>

###### 2. Type Values into the Slider 🔢

You can now type values directly on the Slider component! Here's what it looks like:

![type-slider](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/192399877-76b662a1-fede-4417-a932-fc15f0da7360.gif)

###### 3. Better Sketching and Inpainting 🎨

We've made a lot of changes to our Image component so that it can support better sketching and inpainting.

Now supports:

- A standalone black-and-white sketch

```python
import gradio as gr
demo = gr.Interface(lambda x: x, gr.Sketchpad(), gr.Image())
demo.launch()
```

![bw](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/192410264-b08632b5-7b2a-4f86-afb0-5760e7b474cf.gif)

- A standalone color sketch

```python
import gradio as gr
demo = gr.Interface(lambda x: x, gr.Paint(), gr.Image())
demo.launch()
```

![color-sketch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/192410500-3c8c3e64-a5fd-4df2-a991-f0a5cef93728.gif)

- An uploadable image with black-and-white or color sketching

```python
import gradio as gr
demo = gr.Interface(lambda x: x, gr.Image(source='upload', tool='color-sketch'), gr.Image()) # for black and white, tool = 'sketch'
demo.launch()
```

![sketch-new](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/192402422-e53cb7b6-024e-448c-87eb-d6a35a63c476.gif)

- Webcam with black-and-white or color sketching

```python
import gradio as gr
demo = gr.Interface(lambda x: x, gr.Image(source='webcam', tool='color-sketch'), gr.Image()) # for black and white, tool = 'sketch'
demo.launch()
```

![webcam-sketch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/192410820-0ffaf324-776e-4e1f-9de6-0fdbbf4940fa.gif)

## 3.3

### New Features:

###### 1. Iterative Outputs ⏳

You can now create an iterative output simply by having your function return a generator!

Here's (part of) an example that was used to generate the interface below it. [See full code](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1m9bWS6B82CT7bw-m4L6AJR8za7fEK7Ov?usp=sharing).

```python
def predict(steps, seed):
    generator = torch.manual_seed(seed)
    for i in range(1,steps):
        yield pipeline(generator=generator, num_inference_steps=i)["sample"][0]
```

![example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/189086273-f5e7087d-71fa-4158-90a9-08e84da0421c.mp4)

###### 2. Accordion Layout 🆕

This version of Gradio introduces a new layout component to Blocks: the Accordion. Wrap your elements in a neat, expandable layout that allows users to toggle them as needed.

Usage: ([Read the docs](https://gradio.app/docs/#accordion))

```python
with gr.Accordion("open up"):
# components here
```

![accordion](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/189088465-f0ffd7f0-fc6a-42dc-9249-11c5e1e0529b.gif)

###### 3. Skops Integration 📈

Our new integration with [skops](https://huggingface.co/blog/skops) allows you to load tabular classification and regression models directly from the [hub](https://huggingface.co/models).

Here's a classification example showing how quick it is to set up an interface for a [model](https://huggingface.co/scikit-learn/tabular-playground).

```python
import gradio as gr
gr.Interface.load("models/scikit-learn/tabular-playground").launch()
```

## 3.2

### New Features:

###### 1. Improvements to Queuing 🥇

We've implemented a brand new queuing system based on **web sockets** instead of HTTP long polling. Among other things, this allows us to manage queue sizes better on Hugging Face Spaces. There are also additional queue-related parameters you can add:

- Now supports concurrent workers (parallelization)

```python
demo = gr.Interface(...)
demo.queue(concurrency_count=3)
demo.launch()
```

- Configure a maximum queue size

```python
demo = gr.Interface(...)
demo.queue(max_size=100)
demo.launch()
```

- If a user closes their tab / browser, they leave the queue, which means the demo will run faster for everyone else

###### 2. Fixes to Examples

- Dataframe examples will render properly, and look much clearer in the UI: (thanks to PR #2125)

![Screen Shot 2022-08-30 at 8 29 58 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/187586561-d915bafb-f968-4966-b9a2-ef41119692b2.png)

- Image and Video thumbnails are cropped to look neater and more uniform: (thanks to PR #2109)

![Screen Shot 2022-08-30 at 8 32 15 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/187586890-56e1e4f0-1b84-42d9-a82f-911772c41030.png)

- Other fixes in PR #2131 and #2064 make it easier to design and use Examples

###### 3. Component Fixes 🧱

- Specify the width and height of an image in its style tag (thanks to PR #2133)

```python
components.Image().style(height=260, width=300)
```

- Automatic conversion of videos so they are playable in the browser (thanks to PR #2003). Gradio will check if a video's format is playable in the browser and, if it isn't, will automatically convert it to a format that is (mp4).
- Pass in a json filepath to the Label component (thanks to PR #2083)
- Randomize the default value of a Slider (thanks to PR #1935)

![slider-random](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/187596230-3db9697f-9f4d-42f5-9387-d77573513448.gif)

- Improvements to State in PR #2100

###### 4. Ability to Randomize Input Sliders and Reload Data whenever the Page Loads

- In some cases, you want to be able to show a different set of input data to every user as they load the page app. For example, you might want to randomize the value of a "seed" `Slider` input. Or you might want to show a `Textbox` with the current date. We now supporting passing _functions_ as the default value in input components. When you pass in a function, it gets **re-evaluated** every time someone loads the demo, allowing you to reload / change data for different users.

Here's an example loading the current date time into an input Textbox:

```python
import gradio as gr
import datetime

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    gr.Textbox(datetime.datetime.now)

demo.launch()
```

Note that we don't evaluate the function -- `datetime.datetime.now()` -- we pass in the function itself to get this behavior -- `datetime.datetime.now`

Because randomizing the initial value of `Slider` is a common use case, we've added a `randomize` keyword argument you can use to randomize its initial value:

```python
import gradio as gr
demo = gr.Interface(lambda x:x, gr.Slider(0, 10, randomize=True), "number")
demo.launch()
```

## 3.1

### New Features:

###### 1. Embedding Demos on Any Website 💻

With PR #1444, Gradio is now distributed as a web component. This means demos can be natively embedded on websites. You'll just need to add two lines: one to load the gradio javascript, and one to link to the demos backend.

Here's a simple example that embeds the demo from a Hugging Face space:

```html
<script
	type="module"
	src="https://gradio.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3.0.18/gradio.js"
></script>
<gradio-app space="abidlabs/pytorch-image-classifier"></gradio-app>
```

But you can also embed demos that are running anywhere, you just need to link the demo to `src` instead of `space`. In fact, all the demos on the gradio website are embedded this way:

<img width="1268" alt="Screen Shot 2022-07-14 at 2 41 44 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/178997124-b2f05af2-c18f-4716-bf1b-cb971d012636.png">

Read more in the [Embedding Gradio Demos](https://gradio.app/embedding_gradio_demos) guide.

###### 2. Reload Mode 👨‍💻

Reload mode helps developers create gradio demos faster by automatically reloading the demo whenever the code changes. It can support development on Python IDEs (VS Code, PyCharm, etc), the terminal, as well as Jupyter notebooks.

If your demo code is in a script named `app.py`, instead of running `python app.py` you can now run `gradio app.py` and that will launch the demo in reload mode:

```bash
Launching in reload mode on: http://127.0.0.1:7860 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
Watching...
WARNING: The --reload flag should not be used in production on Windows.
```

If you're working from a Jupyter or Colab Notebook, use these magic commands instead: `%load_ext gradio` when you import gradio, and `%%blocks` in the top of the cell with the demo code. Here's an example that shows how much faster the development becomes:

![Blocks](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/178986488-ed378cc8-5141-4330-ba41-672b676863d0.gif)

###### 3. Inpainting Support on `gr.Image()` 🎨

We updated the Image component to add support for inpainting demos. It works by adding `tool="sketch"` as a parameter, that passes both an image and a sketchable mask to your prediction function.

Here's an example from the [LAMA space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/akhaliq/lama):

![FXApVlFVsAALSD-](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/178989479-549867c8-7fb0-436a-a97d-1e91c9f5e611.jpeg)

###### 4. Markdown and HTML support in Dataframes 🔢

We upgraded the Dataframe component in PR #1684 to support rendering Markdown and HTML inside the cells.

This means you can build Dataframes that look like the following:

![image (8)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/178991233-41cb07a5-e7a3-433e-89b8-319bc78eb9c2.png)

###### 5. `gr.Examples()` for Blocks 🧱

We've added the `gr.Examples` component helper to allow you to add examples to any Blocks demo. This class is a wrapper over the `gr.Dataset` component.

<img width="1271" alt="Screen Shot 2022-07-14 at 2 23 50 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/178992715-c8bc7550-bc3d-4ddc-9fcb-548c159cd153.png">

gr.Examples takes two required parameters:

- `examples` which takes in a nested list
- `inputs` which takes in a component or list of components

You can read more in the [Examples docs](https://gradio.app/docs/#examples) or the [Adding Examples to your Demos guide](https://gradio.app/adding_examples_to_your_app/).

###### 6. Fixes to Audio Streaming

With [PR 1828](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/1828) we now hide the status loading animation, as well as remove the echo in streaming. Check out the [stream_audio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/demo/stream_audio/run.py) demo for more or read through our [Real Time Speech Recognition](https://gradio.app/real_time_speech_recognition/) guide.

## 3.0

###### 🔥 Gradio 3.0 is the biggest update to the library, ever.

### New Features:

###### 1. Blocks 🧱

Blocks is a new, low-level API that allows you to have full control over the data flows and layout of your application. It allows you to build very complex, multi-step applications. For example, you might want to:

- Group together related demos as multiple tabs in one web app
- Change the layout of your demo instead of just having all of the inputs on the left and outputs on the right
- Have multi-step interfaces, in which the output of one model becomes the input to the next model, or have more flexible data flows in general
- Change a component's properties (for example, the choices in a Dropdown) or its visibility based on user input

Here's a simple example that creates the demo below it:

```python
import gradio as gr

def update(name):
    return f"Welcome to Gradio, {name}!"

demo = gr.Blocks()

with demo:
    gr.Markdown(
    """
    # Hello World!
    Start typing below to see the output.
    """)
    inp = gr.Textbox(placeholder="What is your name?")
    out = gr.Textbox()

    inp.change(fn=update,
               inputs=inp,
               outputs=out)

demo.launch()
```

Read our [Introduction to Blocks](http://gradio.app/introduction_to_blocks/) guide for more, and join the 🎈 [Gradio Blocks Party](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Gradio-Blocks/README)!

###### 2. Our Revamped Design 🎨

We've upgraded our design across the entire library: from components, and layouts all the way to dark mode.

![kitchen_sink](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/168686333-7a6e3096-3e23-4309-abf2-5cd7736e0463.gif)

###### 3. A New Website 💻

We've upgraded [gradio.app](https://gradio.app) to make it cleaner, faster and easier to use. Our docs now come with components and demos embedded directly on the page. So you can quickly get up to speed with what you're looking for.

![website](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/168687191-10d6a3bd-101f-423a-8193-48f47a5e077d.gif)

###### 4. New Components: Model3D, Dataset, and More..

We've introduced a lot of new components in `3.0`, including `Model3D`, `Dataset`, `Markdown`, `Button` and `Gallery`. You can find all the components and play around with them [here](https://gradio.app/docs/#components).

![Model3d](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9021060/168689062-6ad77151-8cc5-467d-916c-f7c78e52ec0c.gif)

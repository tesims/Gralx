    """ANSI/AAMI EC13 Test Waveforms, 3a and 3b

ANSI/AAMI EC13 Test Waveforms 3a and 3b, as obtained from the PhysioBank
database.

**Details**

The following text is reproduced (abridged) from PhysioBank, page
https://www_physionet_org/content/aami-ec13/1.0.0/. Other recordings
belong to the dataset and can be obtained from the same page.

The files in this set can be used for testing a variety of devices that
monitor the electrocardiogram. The recordings include both synthetic and
real waveforms. For details on these test waveforms and how to use them,
please refer to section 5.1.2.1, paragraphs (e) and (g) in the reference
below. Each recording contains one ECG signal sampled at 720 Hz with
12-bit resolution.

Notes
-----

Timestamps in the datasets have been re-created at the indicated
frequency of 720 Hz, whereas the original timestamps in ms (at least in
text format) only had three decimal digitsâ€™ precision, and were
therefore affected by substantial jittering.

Examples

>>> from dtw import *; import numpy as np
>>> (aami3a, aami3b) = dtw_test_data.aami()

Timestamps (ms) are in the first row, values (mV) in the second.

>>> with np.printoptions(precision=3): print(aami3a[0,:])   # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
[0.000e+00 1.389e+00 2.778e+00 ... 5.983e+04 5.983e+04 5.983e+04]
